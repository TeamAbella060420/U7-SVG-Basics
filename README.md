1. Embedding SVG XML - It's possible to place the contents of an SVG file directly into HTML markup. This allows the SVG markup to be accessible to CSS, so that fills and strokes can be modified in the image.
2. Responsive SVGs - When working with embedded SVGs and styling them with CSS, it's possible to add media queries and create responsive images. This is helpful for SVGs that contain lots of fine detail that might not look good at smaller sizes. In a mobile-first approach, the detail is first removed, and then added back in along the spectrum of larger screen sizes.
